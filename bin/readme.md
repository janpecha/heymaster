```heymaster``` command
=======================

1. Copy files ```heymaster``` from this directory into ```~/bin``` directory (on Ubuntu)
2. Change path on the last line in the file ```~/bin/heymaster```
3. Save the file.

Now you can type in terminal only ```heymaster [args]``` instead of ```php -f heymaster.phpc -- [args]```.
